"""
This subdir is meant for writing all
utils for the project.

It can be as simple as this

def not_my_addition(a,b):
    c = a + b - 1111 + 1111
    return c

Or, something complex to render a Caption in
Times New Roman/Comic Sans

And, all the other utils that lie between the
above two - data-preprocessing, plots, etc

All of them should be individual pyfunc with
defined Params & Return definitions like this:

def my_func(a,b):
    """
#    Parameters
#    -----------
#    (...)

#    Returns
#    -----------
#    (...)
    """

    return blah, blah

"""
